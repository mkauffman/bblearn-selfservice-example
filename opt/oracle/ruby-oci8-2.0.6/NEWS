2.0.6:

* Fixed issues

  - fix SEGV when freeing a temporary LOB during GC on rubinius 1.2.3.

  - revert the exception type from RuntimeError to OCIException when
    a closed OCI handle's method is called. It was chaned in 2.0.5
    by mistake.

2.0.5:

* New Features

  - Support Rubinius.

  - OraNumber#has_decimal_part? -> boolean

      OraNumber(10).has_decimal_part?   # => false
      OraNumber(10.1).has_decimal_part? # => true

  - Limitted support for OraNumber's positive and negative infinity.

    They are converted to '~' and '-~' respectively as described in
    <URL:http://www.ixora.com.au/notes/infinity.htm>.

  - OCI8.properties is added to control ruby-oci8 behaviour.
    It supports :bind_string_as_nchar only for now.

  - OCI8.properties[:bind_string_as_nchar] is added.

    You need to set "OCI8.properties[:bind_string_as_nchar] = true"
    if the database character set is not UTF-8 and NCHAR/NVARCHAR2 columns
    contain characters which cannot be converted to the database character set.

* Fixed issues

  - Fix InvalidHandle errors on Rails.
    (reported by Jordan Curzon and Aaron Qian)
    See: http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?thread_id=49751&forum_id=1078

  - Raise "OCIError: ORA-01805: possible error in date/time operation"
    when Oracle 11gR2's client and server timezone versions are not same
    instead of raising a exception "undefined method `*' for nil:NilClass."
    See: http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?thread_id=49102&forum_id=1078

  - Fix unexpectedly disconnect when failed-logon connections is GC'ed
    and the connection object's address is accidentally same with
    an alive connection.

  - Fix segmentation fault when calling OCI8::Cursor#[] for
    closed statement object's (reported by Hugo L. Borges)

  - Fix a bug that a string is bound to RAW.
    Its encoding had been convertd to OCI.encoding incorrectly.

  - Fix memory leaks when temporary lobs are used.

  - Fix a problem to assign NULL bind value to object type bind variables.
    (reported by Raimonds Simanovskis)

  - Support LOB datatypes in object type.
    (reported by Michael Sexton)

  - Fix to compile on cygwin. The declaration of 'boolean' in Oracle
    conflicts with that of latest cygwin.
    (reported by Don Hill).

  - Fix to complie for the 32-bit ruby which was compiled on x86_64 linux
    and configured without '--build', '--host' nor '--target'.
    The RUBY_PLATFORM is 'x86_64-linux' even though the ruby is 32-bit.
    (reported by Jason Renschler)

  - Fix wrong dependencies in Makefile when running 'make -jNNN (where NNN >= 2)'
    (contributed by Alyano Alyanos. See bug #28129 on rubyforge.)

  - Fix to compile on HP-UX. Duplicated const qualifiers prevented HP-UX cc
    from compiling. (reported by Sebastian YEPES)

2.0.4:

* New Features

  - OCI8.error_message(message_no) -> string

    Gets the Oracle error message specified by message id.
    Its language depends on NLS_LANGUAGE.

    Note: This method is unavailable if the Oracle client
          version is 8.0.

      # When NLS_LANG is AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8
      OCI8.error_message(1)
      # => "ORA-00001: unique constraint (%s.%s) violated"

      # When NLS_LANG is FRENCH_FRANCE.AL32UTF8
      OCI8.error_message(1)
      # => "ORA-00001: violation de contrainte unique (%s.%s)"

  - OraNumber#dump -> string

    Returns OraNumber's internal representation whose format
    is same with the return value of Oracle SQL function DUMP().
  
      OraNumber.new(100).dump #=> "Typ=2 Len=2: 194,2"
      OraNumber.new(123).dump #=> "Typ=2 Len=3: 194,2,24"
      OraNumber.new(0.1).dump #=> "Typ=2 Len=2: 192,11"

* Fixed issues

  - Fractional second part is lost when ruby's Time instance is bound
    to Oracle datatype TIMESTAMP.
    (reported by Raimonds Simanovskis)

  - OraNumber#to_i and OraNumber#to_s fail when its scale is larger
    than 38.
    (reported by Raimonds Simanovskis)

  - Memory leak about 30 bytes per one place holder for object type.
 
  - Segmentation fault when a collection of string is bound.
    (reported by Raimonds Simanovskis)

  - Segmentation fault when GC starts while initializing a bind
    object for object type.
    (reported by Remi Gagnon)

  - Segmentation fault when OCI8::Cursor#fetch is called prior to
    OCI8::Cursor#exec.

  - Detailed error message is not reported when PL/SQL NO_DATA_FOUND
    exception is raised.
    (reported by Raimonds Simanovskis)

2.0.3:

* Incompatible Changes

  - Number column in a SQL statement

    Changes the default data type for number column which fit neither
    Integer nor Float from OraNumber to BigDecimal.

      conn.exec("select 1.0 from dual") do |row|
        p row[0] # => BigDecimal("1") if the ruby-oci8 version is 2.0.3.
                 # => OraNumber(1) if the version is 2.0.2.
      end

  - Priority of OraNumber within numerical types

    The return types of basic arithmetic operations with other numerical
    types are changed.

    2.0.3:
      OraNumber + Integer    => OraNumber  (OraNumber wins.)
      OraNumber + Float      => Float      (OraNumber loses.)
      OraNumber + Rational   => Rational   (OraNumber loses.)
      OraNumber + BigDecimal => BigDecimal (OraNumber loses.)

    2.0.2:
      OraNumber + Integer    => OraNumber  (OraNumber wins always.)
      OraNumber + Float      => OraNumber
      OraNumber + Rational   => OraNumber
      OraNumber + BigDecimal => OraNumber

  - Interval day to second

    The retrived value of Oracle data type "interval day to second"
    was changed from the number of days as a Rational to the number
    of seconds as a Float by default.
    Use OCI8::BindType::IntervalDS.unit = :day to make it compatible
    with the previous versions.

      conn.exec("select to_dsinterval('0 00:00:01') from dual") do |row|
        p row[0] # => 1.0 if the version is 2.0.3 and
                 #    OCI8::BindType::IntervalDS.unit is :second.
                 # => (1/86400) if the version is 2.0.3 and
		 #    OCI8::BindType::IntervalDS.unit is :day or
		 #    the version is 2.0.2.
      end

  - Date, timestamp, timestamp with time zone data types and ruby 1.9.2

    These data types are retrived always as Time values when the
    ruby version is 1.9.2 because the Time class is enhanced to
    represent any time zone and is free from year 2038 problem.

    Prior to ruby 1.9.2, if the time cannot be represented by
    Unix time or the time zone is neither utc nor local, they are
    retrived as DateTime values.

  - Non-blocking mode and ruby 1.9

    non-blocking mode is enabled by default when the ruby is 1.9.

* New Features

  - BigDecimal and Rational are availabe as bind values.

  - New methods OCI8#module=, OCI8#action= and OCI8#client_info= are added.

    These methods change the module name, the action name and the client_info
    in the current session respectively.

    After Oracle 10g client, these don't perform network round trips.
    The change is reflected to the server by the next round trip such as
    OCI8#exec, OCI8#ping, etc.

    Prior to Oracle 10g client, these call PL/SQL functions such as
    DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE, DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION,
    and DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_CLIENT_INFO internally.
    The change is reflected immediately by a network round trip.

  - OCI8::BindType.default_timezone

    The default time zone of Time or DateTime values.
    This parameter is used only when
    (1) date values are fetched and the Oracle client version is 8.x
    or
    (2) object types have date data type attributes.

    Note that if the Oracle client version is 9i or upper, the time
    zone is determined by the session time zone. The default value
    is local time zone. You can change it to GMT by executing the
    following SQL statement for each connection.

       alter session set time_zone = '00:00'

* Other specification changes

  - Add a global function OraNumber(obj) as a shortcut of OraNumber.new(obj)
    as Rational and BigDecimal do.

  - Fix to accept nil attribute in object type's
    constructors. This works only for simple data types such as number,
    string. But it doesn't for complex types such as object types.
    (requested by Remi Gagnon)

  - add DATE datatype support in object types.

  - Change OCI8::LOB#write to accept an object which is not a String and
    doesn't respond to 'to_str' as IO#write does.
    (requested by Christopher Jones)

  - Change the initial polling interval of
    non-blocking mode for ruby 1.8 from 100 msec to 10 msec, which
    is same with ruby-oci8 1.0.

* Fixed installation issues.

  - Fix oraconf.rb for ruby 1.8.5 with Oracle 8.x which needs some object
    files to link with.
    (reported by Jayson Cena)

  - Fix oraconf.rb for ruby 1.9.2 preview1.
    (pointed by Raimonds Simanovskis)

  - Fix oraconf.rb to compile for AIX instant clients.
    (reported by Kazuya Teramoto)

2.0.2:

* add new methods
  - OCI8#select_one(sql, *bindvars)  -> first_row

  - OCI8#ping   -> true or false

    Verifies that the Oracle connection is alive.
    OCI8#ping also can be used to flush all the pending OCI
    client-side calls to the server if any exist.

  - OCI8#client_identifier = client_id

    Look at the following link to know what is the client identifier.
      http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-solutions/oracle-session-tracing-part-i-16356

    Note that the specified identifier doesn't change the v$session
    immediately. It is done by the next network round trip
    such as OCI8#exec or OCI8#ping.

* fix problems when compiling with Oracle 9.2 and 8.0.
  (reported by Axel Reinhold)

* [dbi] fix to pass a newly added sanity check in dbi 0.4.1.
  (reported by Dirk Herzhauser)

* fix an error when executing "select NULL from dual".
  http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?thread_id=32468&forum_id=1078
  (contributed by Raimonds Simanovskis)

* [ruby 1.9] fix OCI8::BLOB to read/write binary. Prior to 2.0.1,
  it was treated as text tagged with NLS_LANG encoding.

* [ruby 1.9] fix to bind string data by the length got from String#bytesize
  converted to OCI8.encoding, not by String#size.

2.0.1:

* release a binary gem for Windows, which contains libraries for both
  ruby 1.8 and ruby 1.9.1.
* add OCI8#oracle_server_version.
* fix bugs when fetching and binding time objects.
